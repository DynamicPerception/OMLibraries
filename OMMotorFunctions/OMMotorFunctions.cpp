  specified by steps() or passed via the two-argument form of move().

  immediately and passed the OM_MOT_DONE value when calling move(),
  indicating that you are free to do other activities while the motor is moving.

  Below is an example of performing a continuous motion move, with a maxSteps()
  value set.  The motor will move at a speed of 1,000 steps/second, and will
  automatically stop its self after 5,000 steps have been taken.  Once the motor
  is stopped, the steps moved value is cleared out, and we're ready to move again.

/** Set Maximum Stepping Speed

 Sets the maximum speed at which the motor will move using the no- or two-
 argument form of move().

 This method controls the speed at which moves are made when requesting
 a move without a specified arrival time.  It does not alter the behavior of the
 step timing mechanism, but instead puts an additional limit on the time calculated
 to take a move such that the motor will be given enough time to make the move
 at the specified speed.

 This method is best used, for example, to limit the speed at which a move() is
 made, when we want that speed to fall between two usable rates, for example, 800
 steps per second is lower than the minimum rate of 1,000 steps per second.

 The following is an example of limiting a move without a specified arrival time
 to 500 steps/second maximum speed:

 @code

 void setup() {
   Motor.maxStepRate(5000);
   Motor.maxSpeed(500);
 }

 void loop() {

  static uint8_t dir = true;

  if( ! Motor.running() {
    move(dir, 1000);
    dir = !dir;
 }

 @endcode

 Additional benefits of the above code is that the timing loop will run at the
 maximum possible speed, allowing for the smoothest and most correct delay
 between steps, but the motor will still be limited to 800 steps per second in
 the above move.

 Note: if you specify a value greater than the currently set maxStepRate(),
 your input will be ignored.

 This method has no effect on the six-argument form of move(), plan(), planRun(),
 or continuous motion movements.

 Due to the nature of the timing calculations, you are limited to one of the

 Please note: the maximum rate here defines how often the step interrupt
 service routine runs.  The higher the rate you use, the greater the amount
 of CPU that will be utilized to run the stepper.  At the maximum rate, over

/** Plan an Interleaved Move

 Plans out an interleaved move with acceleration and deceleration profile.

 This method plans out a complex movement that is to be made out of several
 smaller, individual movements.  This allows one to interleave motor movement
 between other activities (such as firing a camera), while maintaining
 user-controlled acceleration and deceleration curves.

 Given a number of interleaved intervals, a total number of steps to move,
 the count of intervals to accelerate to full speed over, and the count
 of intervals to decelerate back to a stop, this method performs all activities
 neccessary.

 After calling this method, you may then use planRun() at each interval to move
 the number of steps.  The number of steps used in each move are automatically
 defined to re-create the desired acceleration and deceleration curves.

 The easing algorithm to use for mapping the planned move (but not making
 Note that the current plan is reset each time you call clear().

 A planned move can result in movement that is not as smooth as that of a
 single move executed over the same period of time.

 During a planned move, the same algorithm ussed to control acceleration and
 velocity in a single move is applied to the plan to determine how many steps
 to take at each interval.  A single move run in real-time has its speed
 varied once per millisecond (see maxStepRate() for more information), however
 a planned move is only able to vary its speed at each interval.  In addition,
 a planned move may only take full steps during each transition, it is not possible
 to spread an individual step across two intervals.* The result of this is that
 for a the planned move to haave the same output smoothness as a single move, there
 must an equivalent number of intervals for the same time period.

 * While it is not possible to spread a single step across two intervals in a
 plannned move, most planned moves do not result in a whole integer of movement at
 each step.  The remainder of a step which was required to be taken but not is
 accumulated until it overflows, and an additional step is taken at this time.
 In this manner, more natural output movement is created given most input
 parameters.

/** Execute the Next Iteration of the Current Plan

 Executes the next move interval as dictated by the current plan.

 If a plan has been created using plan(), this method makes the next movement
 as defined in the current plan.  This method is used to create interleaved
 movement, wherein the motor moves between some other activity.  At each call
 to planRun(), the next set of steps is executed.  The plan() method initiates
 the plan, and this method carries it out as needed.

 A movment using planRun() is always executed at the maximum speed allowed, as
 defined by maxStepRate().  If this is too fast for your motor, you must use
 maxStepRate() to set your step rate to the value nearest, and lower than that
 which can be achieved by your motor.

 If a move can be executed, asynchronous movement is initiated and the
 callback is called.  OM_MOT_BEGIN will be passed to the callback when the
 motion sequence begins.  After the motion sequence has been completed, the
 callback will be called again with the OM_MOT_DONE argument.

 If the motor is disabled, the maximum # of steps has been reached, or the
 plan has been fully executed the callback will be executed with the OM_MOT_DONE
 argument immediately, and no move will take place.

 The following is an example of a simple interleaved motion using plan() and planRun():

 @code
 #include "TimerOne.h";
 #include "OMMotorFunctions.h":

 OMMotorFunctions Motor = OMMotorFunctions();

 volatile uint8_tean okNext = true;

 unsigned int totalIntervals = 500;
 unsigned int totalSteps = 2000;
    // 20% of time accelerating
 unsigned int accelTm = totalSteps / 5;
    // 10% of time decelerating
 unsigned int decelTm = totalSteps / 10;

 void setup() {
    Serial.begin(19200);

     // setup motor
    Motor.enable(true);
    Motor.ms(1);

    Motor.setHandler(motorCB);

     // set max step rate
    Motor.maxStepRate(1000);

    // plan our interleaved move
    Motor.plan(totalIntervals, true, totalSteps, accelTm, decelTm);
 }

 void loop() {

    static unsigned int intervalsTaken = 0;

    if( okNext && intervalsTaken < totalIntervals ) {
        // do something, like fire a camera

        intervalsTaken++;
        okNext = false;
         // execute next planned moved

        Motor.planRun();
    }
 }

 void motorCB(byte code) {
   if( code == OM_MOT_DONE ) {
     okNext = true;
   }
 }
 @endcode

 In this example, we plan a move over 500 intervals to travel 1000 steps and
 spend 20% of the total movement accelerating, while spending 10% decelerating.
 After each activity has occurred, we call planRun() to move the motor.

 While the motor is moving, the value of okNext stays false, and when the move
 is completed, the callback named motorCB() is called.  This callback checks the
 code returned, and if it indicates the motor has completed movement, it changes
 the value of okNext to true, where the main loop then takes another activity and
 moves the motor again.

/** Move Now

 Executes a move immediately using the provided parameters.

 This is the most simple way to execute a complete move in continuous motion

 The easing algorithm used can be configured via the easing() method.

 Specify the time you to arrive at the destination position (in mS from now),
 how much of that time is spent accelerating (the shorter this time, the sharper the
 easing curve), and how much of that time is spent decelerating to a stop.  The
 motor will arrive at the given position, in the given time (with an error rate not
 to exceed 0.00024% for most moves), having eased in and out of the maximum speed
 required to complete the move in time.

 If a move can be executed, asynchronous movement is initiated and the
