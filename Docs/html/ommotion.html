<div class="textblock"><p>The Motor Manager class is capable of automatically making complex moves on your behalf. It supports both linear and quadratic easing, with specified acceleration, deceleration, and arrival times.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="movedefs"></a>
Defining A Move</h1>
<p>A move can be defined in a number of ways, but the most interesting move is one which has five attributes specified:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Distance to move </li>
<li>
Time to arrive at final point </li>
<li>
Time to accelerate to full speed </li>
<li>
Time to decelerate to a stop </li>
</ul>
<p>Moves such as these allow you to map out complex motions without having to concern yourself as to how they are achieved. The <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html" title="Motor Manager.">OMMotor</a> library automatically performs all calculations so that it arrives at the specified destination at exactly the specified time, with the exact accel and decel times you specify.</p>
<p>To add additional control over these complex moves, the Motor Manager class also provides several types of easing, to control how acceleration and deceleration occur in these moves. For more information on the easing algorithms, see the Easing section below.</p>
<p>While this class allows you to specify very complex moves, for some purposes you may find it advantageous to use the asynchronous motor driving without concerning yourself with acceleration, deceleration, or easing. In this case, a two-argument form of <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html#a68c0b61b84e4e095b6463cadc275adae">OMMotor::move()</a> is provided which only requires you to define a direction and a number of steps. When only a direction and steps are provided, the class uses the linear easing algorithm and moves the motor at the specified maximum speed. In the case of simple moves such as this, the acceleration and deceleration are fixed at a rate of 25% of the total time it takes to make the move.</p>
<p>For all moves, there is no error checking to see if you've specified a speed or parameters for a move that cannot actually be achieved. The maximum speed of movement is controlled by <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html#ad4445e8f1adc4efac5f792af25f7e660">OMMotor::maxStepRate()</a> and <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html#a027801e9563fbed2ee39de06e90abc0d">OMMotor::maxSpeed()</a>, and not direct observation of the motor. Therefore, it is possible to set speeds which cannot be achieved by your specific motor. For more information on how to limit the speed of your motor or control the amount of CPU time spent running the motor, see the <a class="el" href="ommotion.html#movespeed">Timing and Speed Controls</a> section below.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="movease"></a>
Easing</h1>
<p>The Motor Manager class applies easing to all moves, allowing for control over how acceleration and deceleration are applied. There are two primary algorithms supported for easing: linear and quadratic. All easing methods can be applied at the maximum step rate of 5,000 steps/second.</p>
<p>Linear easing allows for quick and highly accurate move calculations. The position of the motor in space follows a smooth, natural curve - however the acceleration profile is entirely linear. This can result in some moves, especially real-time video moves appearing "robotic" or "mechanical" in the output video. However, some moves will benefit from this method, especially very precise moves as linear easing has no error during a real-time move, whereas quadratic easing has a very small error rate which becomes more apparent in shorter moves. (This error rate is usually less than 0.05 steps past the expected position, meaning it has little impact on most moves.)</p>
<p>Quadratic easing provides an acceleration curve which is non-linear, and can provide smooth transitions in speed - with a fluid curve that appears more like that which a human can produce rather than the linear change in speed produced by a computer.</p>
<p>The following diagrams show the difference between linear and quadratic easing applied to the same move of 2,000 steps over 500 seconds, with 100 seconds in acceleration and 200 in deceleration:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="chart_mposprofile.png" />
</div>
<div class="image">
<img src="chart_mspeedprofile.png" />
</div>
<p>As we can see from the above graphs, both moves arrive at the same point and at the same time and reach their top speeds at the same time, but the quadratic acceleration profile results in a higher top speed where the acceleration begins slowly and then increases as it nears the crusing speed. Quadratic deceleration, likewise, starts decelerating slowly and increases as the move reaches a stop.</p>
<p>While normal quadratic easing provides us a period where acceleration increases as we reach the top speed, there are cases where it would be advantageous to do the inverse - that is, invert the acceleration curve so that it starts at the maximum acceleration rate and the rate of acceleration decreases as the move nears its cruising speed. This easing mode is provided as the inverse quadratic easing mode.</p>
<p>The following diagrams illustrate the difference between the two forms of easing and their effects on the placement and speed of the motor over time:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="chart_miqpos.png" />
</div>
<div class="image">
<img src="chart_miqspeed.png" />
</div>
<p>Here we find that the acceleration begins so sharply that the maximum speed is reduced.</p>
<p>Using an inverse quadratic easing algorithm with acceleration and deceleration periods nearest to dead-center in time will result in an approximation of the smoothstep algorithm. E.g.: specifying a move of 2000 steps, over 500 seconds with 249 seconds spent accelerating and 249 seconds spent decelerating, results in the following speed profile:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="chart_mqs.png" />
</div>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="seteasing"></a>
Setting the Easing Mode</h1>
<p>To set the type of easing applied to subsequent moves, use the <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html#a55b7db1caa5d2b73603d94af75a974a1">OMMotor::easing()</a> method. This method accepts a single argument which should be one of the following constants:</p>
<ul>
<li>
OM_MOT_LINEAR </li>
<li>
OM_MOT_QUAD </li>
<li>
OM_MOT_QUADINV </li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting between linear, quadratic, and inverse quadratic easing.</p>
<p>It is not possible to change the easing mode while a move is in progress, and you are advised to abandon any planned move before changing the easing mode.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="planmoves"></a>
Planned and Interleaved Moves</h1>
<p>In addition to performing complex single moves, the <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html" title="Motor Manager.">OMMotor</a> class also supports performing the same complex moves in an interleaved fashion, such as with shoot-move-shoot systems, where the motor must move only between some activity, but you want to end at a certain position while having followed a natural path. Using the <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html#a00a5361f6de10d4953f3af31f8e8e60f">OMMotor::plan()</a> and <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html#a5c625e3894926c9123979312ab13a746">OMMotor::planRun()</a> methods, you can plan out a complex move across many intervals, and then execute each stage of the move as needed.</p>
<p>When planning an interleaved move, the currently selected easing algorithm is applied to the move as a whole, and divided across the specified intervals such that only whole steps are taken at each execution interval. For this reason, planned moves will almost always be less smooth than continuous moves unless there are an equivalent number of intervals in the planned move as there are step cycles in the continuous move. For smoothest and most natural movement, continuous is preferred.</p>
<p>The following chart shows how a hypothetical move is calculated across 100 intervals, showing the distance traveled at each interval point:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="chart_mplan.png" />
</div>
<p>Of course, each interval must have a whole number of steps, while reaching the destination given the planned parameters may require us to take fractional steps at each interval. This error rate is accumulated and corrected every time we accumulate a whole step of error. We can see this happening in the above image, where we occasionally take an extra step to catch up with our expected position. This error-correction will always exhibit as a single additional step in one interval cycle at a time.</p>
<p>For more information on how to plan interleaved moves, see <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html#a00a5361f6de10d4953f3af31f8e8e60f">OMMotor::plan()</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="steptiming"></a>
The Stepping Cycle</h1>
<p>Asynchronous motion is achieved by utilizing the Timer1 library to trigger an interrupt service routine every given time period, with a microsecond resolution. During one of these time periods, it is possible to either take a full step of the motor, or sit idle. During a cycle in which a step is to be taken, the step pin is brought both high and back to low during that one timing cycle.</p>
<table  border="1" width="60%">
<tr bgcolor="#CACACA">
<td>200uS</td><td>400uS</td><td>600uS</td><td>800uS</td><td>1000uS</td><td>1200uS</td><td>1400uS</td><td>1600uS  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFAAAA">step</td><td bgcolor="#AAFFAA" colspan="4">idle</td><td bgcolor="#FFAAAA">step</td><td bgcolor="#AAffAA" colspan="2">idle  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Speed of the motor is controlled by the number of off-cycles between each step, which is continuously varied by re-calculating the desired position of the motor at set intervals. During motion, this interval is always set to 1mS of movement, thus the speed of the motor is adjusted 1,000 times per second to give as fluid of motion as is possible while minimizing CPU utilization.</p>
<table  border="1" width="60%">
<tr bgcolor="#CCCCFF">
<td colspan="5">1 mS</td><td colspan="5">2 mS  </td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#CACACA">
<td>200uS</td><td>400uS</td><td>600uS</td><td>800uS</td><td>1000uS</td><td>1200uS</td><td>1400uS</td><td>1600uS  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFAAAA">step</td><td bgcolor="#AAFFAA" colspan="4">idle</td><td bgcolor="#FFAAAA">step</td><td bgcolor="#AAffAA" colspan="2">idle  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>It would seem that we could simply set the time periods extremely small, say 20uS, to increase the maximum stepping speed. However, since we have to do actual work in these timing slices (decide whether to take a step or not, update position, etc.) - and not to mention that we have to perform a complex calculation during one cycle every millisecond to re-calculate our current speed, we must account for this time spent. The worst-case observed times to perform all of these activities are 20uS for controlling the stepping pattern, and 170uS for re-calculating the current speed using the quadratic easing algorithm. (linear performs more quickly.)</p>
<p>If we were to take longer inside of our interrupt service routine doing our activities than the timer is set for, our observation of time will be flawed. For this reason, we must allow enough time to complete all activities required in each time slice. This is why the maximum step rate is set to 5,000 steps per second, or once every 200uS.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="movespeed"></a>
Timing and Speed Controls</h1>
<p>As discussed in the section <a class="el" href="ommotion.html#steptiming">The Stepping Cycle</a> above, there is a maximum rate at which stepping can occur, and CPU consumed driving the motor is inversely proportional to the rate specified. Therefore, if you have an application that is otherwise quite busy doing non-motor activities, such as polling sensors or reading user input, you may wish to reduce the rate at which stepping occurs to free up more CPU time.</p>
<p>Reducing CPU consumption by decreasing the rate at which the stepping cycle runs reduces the accuracy of real-time speeds, the smoothness of velocity changes and the maximum speed at which any move can be executed. Therefore, the stepping rate should only be modified lower than the maximum when required.</p>
<p>As timing requirements limit the stepping cycle to whole microsecond periods greater than 200uS, you are limited to the following choices in stepping rates: 5000, 4000, 2000, and 1000.</p>
<p>To control the maximum speed of simple moves (the two-argument form of <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html#a68c0b61b84e4e095b6463cadc275adae">OMMotor::move()</a> ) and moves executed during a planned movement, you may use the <a class="el" href="class_o_m_motor.html" title="Motor Manager.">OMMotor</a>:setMaxSpeed() command. Setting the maximum speed, instead of the maximum stepping rate, can be used to limit these types of movements to the actual speed at which your motor can travel when it is not one of the available rate options.</p>
<p>Complex moves that specify all parameters are always attempted to be executed as requested, even if it results in a higher speed than specified by the maximum rate or maximum speed. This can result in unexpected behavior from the motor and one should adjust their distance or arrival time accordingly. </p>
